# Common issue: In case of incompatibility error after 'poetry add <package>', just set the --python property to the one
# suggested at the end of the error message. e.g.:
# output message: ... a possible solution would be to set the `python` property to ">=3.10,<3.11"
# solution: $ poetry add pandas-profiling --python ">=3.10,<3.11"
